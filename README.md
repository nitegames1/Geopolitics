# Geopolitics

This project is built with **Vite** and **React**. The following commands help you get up and running.

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will start on <http://localhost:5173> by default.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output is placed in the `dist/` directory.

## Serve the production build

After building, you can serve the files locally with:

```bash
node server.js
```

This starts a simple HTTP server at <http://localhost:5000>.

## Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing.
